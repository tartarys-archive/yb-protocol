# yb-protocol
An open, non-coercive ethical signaling protocol for Web3 communities.  Yellow = notice. Black = unresolved public record.
# Yellow–Black (Y-B) Protocol

The Yellow–Black Protocol is an open ethical signaling framework.

It enables communities to:
- issue non-coercive notices (Yellow)
- document unresolved ethical breaches (Black)
- provide a public, time-stamped path to resolution

The protocol does not enforce outcomes.
It records signals.

Authority emerges from community recognition, not force.

## Principles
- Transparency over punishment
- Notice before escalation
- Right to response
- Public memory, no coercion

## Status
Draft v1  
Maintained under the guardianship of the Tartarys community.
